# School District Analysis

## Overview of the school district
There was evidence of academic dishonest in the reading and math grades for Thomas High School ninth graders. We were tasked with the math and reading scores for Thomas High School with NaNs while keeping the rest of the data intact. After replacing the math and reading scoresthe school district analysis was re-run and compared to the results before the ninth graders scores from Thomas High School were removed. 

## Results: Using bulleted lists and images of DataFrames as support, address the following questions.

- The district summary was relatively the same with all scores being effected by less than 1%
- The school summary was uneffected.
- The performance of Thomas High School was uneffected
- How does replacing the ninth-grade scores affect the following:
- The reading and math scores are NaNs for Thomas High School
- The scores by school spending were uneffected
- The scores by school size were uneffected
- The scores by school type were uneffected

## Summary
The removal of the nineth graders from the overall district results had little effect. However when they are left as NaNs they reduced the average math score, reduced the students passing math, reduced the students passing reading, and reduced the overall student pass rate.
